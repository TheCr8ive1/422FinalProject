# 422FinalProject


This repository contains all resources implemented and used for calculation and modeling for our project. The preprocessing.py file is utilized to generate the features we utilized in this project, and requires no special packages. The featureselectionandmodeling.py file performs the feature selection and modeling sections of the project and required several packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, and matplotlib. All but sklearn are relatively standard packages, and sklearn is a specialized package to perform our ML techniques. 

All scripts will require some modification to your local file structure or the code to manage file paths. All code is submitted in known working fashion and has been tested prior to submission.
